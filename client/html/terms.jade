  p This Beta User Account Agreement (“Agreement”) is part of and incorporates by reference all terms, conditions rules, policies and guidelines on the Site, including the Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”). This Agreement is effective January 1, 2014. Your continued use of the Site will signify your acceptance of this Agreement.

  p At this time, Spongie is still considered under development and in ‘beta testing’. Beta version products are not fully supported, and are likely to contain defects. If you use a beta version software product then you are getting an exclusive look at a new software product and you are also acting as a beta test team member, therefore any bugs, problems or suggested improvements should be reported to: support@spongie.org. To access Site Services or become a Member you must register for a Spongie Account (“Account”). When a Member registers an Account, the Member will be asked to choose a username and password for the Account. As a Member, you agree and you are entirely responsible to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of the username and password you use to access this Site. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of the Account or access to your password.

You agree to use good judgment when posting information, remarks or other content regarding other Users, Members, Clients, Spongie or any other third party. Under federal law (specifically, the Communications Decency Act of 1996), Spongie is not legally responsible for any remarks, information or other content posted or made available on its Site by any User or third party, even if such information or content is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable. Spongie is not responsible for and does not monitor or censor content for accuracy or reliability. Spongie reserves the right to remove or restrict access to any information, content in its sole and absolute discretion, or if ordered to do so by a court, or if Spongie considers such information or content to be in violation of the Spongie Terms of Service.
